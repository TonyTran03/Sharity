# **Sharity**

Sharity is a web-based platform designed to support charities by acting as a centralized database for resources. Inspired by the way hospitals or libraries share resources when local supplies run low, Sharity allows charities to request and view the resources of other charities in real-time. Additionally, users can create donation invoices that can be scanned at their selected charity to validate their donation, ensuring that the system is updated instantly.

## Features
- Resource Sharing: Charities can request and view the available resources of other charities within the network.
- Real-Time Updates: The system updates in real-time as resources are requested, donated, or allocated.
- Donation Invoices: Users can generate donation invoices, which can be scanned at the charity to validate and log the donation.
- Google Maps Integration: The platform utilizes Google Maps to provide a geographical view of the participating charities and their available resources.
- Secure Authentication: Authentication is handled via Auth0, ensuring that user data and charity information are secure.
- Future Enhancements: Blockchain technology will soon be implemented to provide an immutable record of donations and resource sharing, ensuring transparency and trust.

## Tech Stack
**Next.js**: A React-based framework used for building the front-end of the application.
**Google Maps API**: Integrated to visualize the locations of charities and the distribution of resources.
**MongoDB**: The database used to store information about charities, resources, and donations.
**Auth0**: Provides secure authentication and authorization services.
**Blockchain** (Upcoming): Will be used to create a transparent and immutable ledger for tracking donations and resource exchanges.
